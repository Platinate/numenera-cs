# numenera-cs
A dynamic character sheet for Numenera 2.0 (Discovery)

The idea is to provide for any player a portable and easy to use application to track thir character.

Each changes is saved in the browser local storage in order to recover character data each time a user is coming back to the app.

## Exporting

If the user want to have his character sheet on multiple devices, he can export his character data by clicking on the *Export* button.

This will generate a file with a *.json* extension. This file can be transfered to any other device and once you've opened the application on the new device, you can load the data by clicking on *Load* button.
